<h5>
    What Is Machine Learning?
</h5>
<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspMachine learning is programming computers to optimize a performance criterion using example
data or past experience. We have a model defined up to some parameters, and learning is the execution 
of a computer program to optimize the parameters of the model using the training data or past experience. 
The model may be predictive to make predictions in the future, or descriptive to gain knowledge from
data, or both.</p>
<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
Arthur Samuel, an early American leader in the field of computer gaming and artificial intelligence,
coined the term ―Machine Learning in 1959 while at IBM. He defined machine learning as ―the field of
study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed. However, there is
no universally accepted definition for machine learning. Different authors define the term differently.
</p>
<h5>Definition of learning</h5>
<h6>Definition</h6>
<p>
    A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and
performance measure P, if its performance at tasks T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.

Definition<br>
<p>
    A computer program which learns from experience is called a machine learning program or
simply a learning program. Such a program is sometimes also referred to as a learner.
</p>
<h4>
    Components of Learning
</h4>
<p>
    Basic components of learning process
The learning process, whether by a human or a machine, can be divided into four components,
namely, data storage, abstraction, generalization and evaluation. Figure 1.1 illustrates the
variouscomponents and the steps involved in the learning process.
</p>
<img src="fig1.1.jpg" width=100%>
<h6>1. Data storage</h6>
<p>
  Facilities for storing and retrieving huge amounts of data are an important component of the
learning process. Humans and computers alike utilize data storage as a foundation for advanced
reasoning.<br>
• In a human being, the data is stored in the brain and data is retrieved using electrochemical signals.
• Computers use hard disk drives, flash memory, random access memory and similar devices to store
data and use cables and other technology to retrieve data.
</p>
<h6>2. Abstraction</h6>
<p>
  The second component of the learning process is known as abstraction.<br>
Abstraction is the process of extracting knowledge about stored data. This involves creating general
concepts about the data as a whole. The creation of knowledge involves application of known models and
creation of new models.<br>
The process of fitting a model to a dataset is known as training. When the model has been trained, the
data is transformed into an abstract form that summarizes the original information.
</p>
<h6>3. Generalization</h6>
<p>
  The third component of the learning process is known as generalisation.<br>
The term generalization describes the process of turning the knowledge about stored data into a form that
can be utilized for future action. These actions are to be carried out on tasks that are similar, but not
identical, to those what have been seen before. In generalization, the goal is to discover those properties
of the data that will be most relevant to future tasks.
</p>
<h6>4. Evaluation</h6>
<p>
  Evaluation is the last component of the learning process.<br>
It is the process of giving feedback to the user to measure the utility of the learned knowledge. This
feedback is then utilised to effect improvements in the whole learning process
  </p>
<h6>Applications of machine learning</h6>
<p>
  Application of machine learning methods to large databases is called data mining. In data
mining, a large volume of data is processed to construct a simple model with valuable use, for example,
having high predictive accuracy.
</p>
<ol type=1>The following is a list of some of the typical applications of machine learning.
  <li>
    In retail business, machine learning is used to study consumer behaviour.
  </li>
  <li>
    In finance, banks analyze their past data to build models to use in credit applications, fraud
detection, and the stock market.
  </li>
  <li>
    In manufacturing, learning models are used for optimization, control, and troubleshooting.
  </li>
  <li>
    In medicine, learning programs are used for medical diagnosis.
  </li>
  <li>
    In telecommunications, call patterns are analyzed for network optimization and maximizing the
quality of service.
  </li>
  <li>
    In science, large amounts of data in physics, astronomy, and biology can only be analyzed fast
enough by computers. The World Wide Web is huge; it is constantly growing and searching for
relevant information cannot be done manually.
  </li>
  <li>
    In artificial intelligence, it is used to teach a system to learn and adapt to changes so that the
system designer need not foresee and provide solutions for all possible situations.
  </li>
  <li>
    It is used to find solutions to many problems in vision, speech recognition, and robotics.
  </li>
  <li>
    Machine learning methods are applied in the design of computer-controlled vehicles to steer
correctly when driving on a variety of roads.
  </li>
  <li>
    Machine learning methods have been used to develop programmes for playing games such as
chess, backgammon and Go.
  </li>
</ol>
<h5>Learning Models</h5>
<p>
  Machine learning is concerned with using the right features to build the right models that
achieve the right tasks. The basic idea of Learning models has divided into three categories.
For a given problem, the collection of all possible outcomes represents the sample space or instance
space.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Using a Logical expression. (<b>Logical models</b>)
  </li>
  <li>
    Using the Geometry of the instance space. (<b>Geometric models</b>)
  </li>
  <li>
    Using Probability to classify the instance space. (<b>Probabilistic models</b>)
  </li>
  <li>
    Grouping and Grading
  </li>
</ul>

<h6>Logical models</h6>
<p>
  Logical models use a logical expression to divide the instance space into segments and hence
construct grouping models. A logical expression is an expression that returns a Boolean value, i.e., a
True or False outcome. Once the data is grouped using a logical expression, the data is divided into
homogeneous groupings for the problem we are trying to solve. For example, for a classificationproblem,
all the instances in the group belong to one class.
</p>
          <p>
            There are mainly two kinds of logical models: Tree models and Rule models.
          </p>
          <p>
            Rule models consist of a collection of implications or IF-THEN rules. For tree-based models, the 'if-part'
defines a segment and the 'then-part' defines the behaviour of the model for this segment. Rule models
follow the same reasoning.
          </p>
          <h6>
            Logical models and Concept learning
          </h6>
          <p>
            To understand logical models further, we need to understand the idea of Concept Learning.
Concept Learning involves learning logical expressions or concepts from examples. The idea of Concept
Learning fits in well with the idea of Machine learning, i.e., inferring a general function from specific
training examples. Concept learning forms the basis of both tree-based and rule-based models. More
formally, Concept Learning involves acquiring the definition of a general category from a given set of
positive and negative training examples of the category. A Formal Definition for Concept Learning is
<b>"The inferring of a Boolean-valued function from training examples of its input and output.”</b> In
concept learning, we only learn a description for the positive class and label everything that doesn‘t
satisfy that description as negative.
